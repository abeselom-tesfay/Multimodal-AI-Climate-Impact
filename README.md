# Multimodal-AI-Climate-Impact

## Project Overview
Multimodal AI system designed to predict climate impact by integrating satellite imagery, environmental sensor data, and temporal climate indicators. The model leverages advanced deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial analysis and Transformers for temporal and multimodal data fusion, to generate accurate, data-driven insights.

## Key Features
- Combines multiple data modalities for holistic climate analysis.
- Employs state-of-the-art architectures (CNNs, Transformers, attention mechanisms) for high-precision predictions.
- Supports analysis of large-scale datasets from public sources like NASA Earth Science Data, Google Earth Engine, and NOAA Climate Data Online.
- Designed for real-world applicability in environmental monitoring, climate change impact assessment, and sustainability planning.

## Objectives
- Develop a robust AI system capable of identifying and predicting environmental changes over time.
- Facilitate research and decision-making in climate mitigation and adaptation strategies.
- Demonstrate the practical integration of cutting-edge AI techniques in an impactful, socially relevant domain.
